class WaterBalanceLayered(SimulationObject):
    """This implements a layered water balance to estimate soil water availability for crop growth and water stress.

    The classic free-drainage water-balance had some important limitations such as the inability to take into
    account differences in soil texture throughout the profile and its impact on soil water flow. Moreover,
    in the single layer water balance, rainfall or irrigation will become immediately available to the crop.
    This is incorrect physical behaviour and in many situations it leads to a very quick recovery of the crop
    after rainfall since all the roots have immediate access to infiltrating water. Therefore, with more detailed
    soil data becoming available a more realistic soil water balance was deemed necessary to better simulate soil
    processes and its impact on crop growth.

    The multi-layer water balance represents a compromise between computational complexity, realistic simulation
    of water content and availability of data to calibrate such models. The model still runs on a daily time step
    but does implement the concept of downward and upward flow based on the concept of hydraulic head and soil
    water conductivity. The latter are combined in the so-called Matric Flux Potential. The model computes
    two types of flow of water in the soil:

      (1) a "dry flow" from the matric flux potentials (e.g. the suction gradient between layers)
      (2) a "wet flow" under the current layer conductivities and downward gravity.

    Clearly, only the dry flow may be negative (=upward). The dry flow accounts for the large
    gradient in water potential under dry conditions (but neglects gravity). The wet flow takes into
    account gravity only and will dominate under wet conditions. The maximum of the dry and wet
    flow is taken as the downward flow, which is then further limited in order the prevent
    (a) oversaturation and (b) water content to decrease below field capacity.
    Upward flow is just the dry flow when it is negative. In this case the flow is limited
    to a certain fraction of what is required to get the layers at equal potential, taking
    into account, however, the contribution of an upward flow from further down.

    The configuration of the soil layers is variable but is bound to certain limitations:

    - The layer thickness cannot be made too small. In practice, the top layer should not
      be smaller than 10 to 20 cm. Smaller layers would require smaller time steps than
      one day to simulate realistically, since rain storms will fill up the top layer very
      quickly leading to surface runoff because the model cannot handle the infiltration of
      the rainfall in a single timestep (a day).
    - The crop maximum rootable depth must coincide with a layer boundary. This is to avoid
      that roots can directly access water below the rooting depth. Of course such water may become
      available gradually by upward flow of moisture at some point during the simulation.

    The current python implementation does not yet implement the impact of shallow groundwater
    but this will be added in future versions of the model.

    For an introduction to the concept of Matric Flux Potential see for example:

        Pinheiro, Everton Alves Rodrigues, et al. “A Matric Flux Potential Approach to Assess Plant Water
        Availability in Two Climate Zones in Brazil.” Vadose Zone Journal, vol. 17, no. 1, Jan. 2018, pp. 1–10.
        https://doi.org/10.2136/vzj2016.09.0083.

    **Note**: the current implementation of the model (April 2024) is rather 'Fortran-ish'. This has been done
    on purpose to allow comparisons with the original code in Fortran90. When we are sure that
    the implementation performs properly, we can refactor this in to a more functional structure
    instead of the current code which is too long and full of loops.


    **Simulation parameters:**

    Besides the parameters in the table below, the multi-layer waterbalance requires
    a `SoilProfileDescription` which provides the properties of the different soil
    layers. See the `SoilProfile` and `SoilLayer` classes for the details.
